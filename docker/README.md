# docker management in ARG

We are collecting docker images in order to reproduce the research in ARG.
The Dockerfile are collected in the sub-folders here.

Nevertheless, given the upgrades of apt or pip packages, we also encountered that we could not reproduce the images from Dockerfile all the time.
Currently we are pushing the images to:
* https://hub.docker.com/u/argnctu/
* https://hub.docker.com/u/peterx7803/

Thanks to Peter Huang who initiate many of those work.
